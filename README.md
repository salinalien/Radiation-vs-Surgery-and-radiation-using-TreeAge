# Radiation vs Surgery and radiation using TreeAge
This repository contains data and results from a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatment strategies for a certain medical condition: the standard treatment involving Radiation alone, and a new treatment combining Surgery and Radiation.


## Methodology
The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using TreeAge Pro to model and compare the outcomes and associated costs of each treatment strategy over a specified time horizon.

### Treatment Strategies
- Standard Treatment: Radiation
New Treatment: Surgery + Radiation

### Files
C-E Analysis.rptx: TreeAge file containing input parameters and model assumptions.
CEAC: Image file displaying the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC).
CEAC in stats form: Statistical data for the CEAC curve.

## Conclusion
Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis conducted, the standard treatment involving Radiation alone has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $6166.67, while the new treatment combining Surgery and Radiation has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $11302.23. This suggests that the standard treatment may be more cost-effective compared to the new treatment, depending on the specific context and WTP threshold.
